The cleaning and pre processing of Covid dataset was done in the Covid.ipynb
The cleaning and pre processing of Stop and Search dataset was done in the Stop_Search.ipynb
The Gui.ipynb contains the Graphical user interface of both covid and stop & search
The Unit_Testing.ipynb contains the unit testing of some functions. Because of the little time, i couldnt do unit testing on some functions. But i believe the once i did are enough

NOTE!!!!!!!! For you to enjoy my work, you just need to run the RUN_ME.ipynb file. Running it will automatically load the Graphical user interface.

i used %run to load my modules because i was finding it hard to import my covid and stop & search. i am glad it's worked


NOTE AGAIN!!!!! For you to enjoy my work, you just need to run the RUN_ME.ipynb file. Running it will automatically load the Graphical user interface.

I hope you really like my work because i put alot of effort into it. Thank you and Enjoy!!!!!
